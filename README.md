# Vechicle-Detection-in-Adverse-Weather
Minor Project 

This project works on the vehicle detection in adverse weather which includes comparision between multiple combinations of 
dehazing techniques and deep learning algorithms to study the accuracy of the algorithms. In this branch, the discussion is 
on classical CLAHE and Dark Prior and the combination of these two algorithms. There are huge differences in the accuracy obtained
to detect obstacles on road.
